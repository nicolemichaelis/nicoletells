* I'm native in English and German and fluent in Swedish.
* I really love words. I write poetry and short stories in my free time and have published a poetry collection. I read dozens of books every year.
* I have over 12 years of experience writing for marketing and design teams.
* I have a Master of Science in Marketing, a BA in Business, and a pre-diploma in Engineering. I also took courses at Hyper Island.
* I teach Content Marketing at Berghs.
* I'm unafraid and love to disrupt. I won't be shy with ideas - we'll create something awesome together.
