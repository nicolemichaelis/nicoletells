## At Hyper Island, I worked full-time as a Digital Marketer with a content focus for 1,5 years.

My focus at Hyper Island was to attract students to long-term programs. I conducted market research to ensure target audience needs were met with the offering and advertising.

**My role:** In-house Digital Content Marketer

**Engagement duration:** 2 years

**Project:** I developed a content strategy that was focused on engagement and a sense of community. I created an average of two articles a week, often based on interviews with students or collaborators. I was also responsible for email communication, paid media and ads, as well as website copy.

**Purpose:** Hyper Island is the leading school for digital business and design and has hubs in Stockholm, New York City, Singapore, Manchester, and Sao Paulo.

**Audience:** Freshly graduated students looking to get into the digital field (YH programs), anyone looking to build on their current career (Masters).

**Outcome:** Increased applications in the Recruitment team by 25% the first year, launched a new website with 18% increase in traffic.
